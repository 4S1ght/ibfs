# Overview
IBFS (Indirect-block filesystem) is a fully custom filesystem designed specifically to provide a virtualization layer for any software that needs to expose filesystem access to the local network, such as self-hosted file servers, network attached storage, upload sites and anything else that requires user-provided data and may benefit from extra security against directory traversal, file inclusion or arbitrary file upload attacks.

> **Note:** This specification will evolve alongside the project and is subject to change.
Currently it's not as much of a specification as it is a form of organizing the plethora of structures, patterns and mechanics used by the filesystem.

## Use cases
Main use cases for the IBFS filesystem are network file sharing and hosting.
The virtualized nature of the filesystem isolates the physical host filesystem from consumers and greatly reduces the surface of many types of attacks.

# Structural design
IBFS is a 64-bit filesystem utilizing a hybrid model that combines unrolled-linked-list and FAT-like allocation table patterns.
At a high level each file and directory consists of a chain of [index blocks](#index-blocks) linked together in an unrolled-linked-list pattern - each of the blocks containing a list of sector addresses pointing to the first sector of a [storage block](#storage-block).

## Root sector
The root sector stores all crucial filesystem metadata necessary for mounting and operation.
Most importantly, it holds the root directory address and cryptographic metadata used to verify decryption keys necessary to operate on the volume if encryption is enabled.

The maximum usable size of the root sector is 1024 bytes - The minimum allowed sector size.

Size | Type   | Description
-----|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------
2B   | Int16  | Major driver version used to create the volume.
2B   | Int16  | Minor version
2B   | Int16  | Patch version
-----|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------
4B   | Int32  | Specifies size of individual sectors in the volume. Allowed 
     |        | values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 kiB respectively, although 
     |        | the implementation does allow for arbitrary values that fit
     |        | within the 1-32kiB range.
-----|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------
8B   | Int64  | Address of the root directory.
-----|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------
2B   | Int16  | AES encryption type used. Allowed values are:
     |        | 0   - No encryption is used.
     |        | 128 - Using AES/XTS 128-bit encryption.
     |        | 256 - Using AES/XTS 256-bit encryption.
-----|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------
8B   | Raw    | AES/XTS initialization vector
     |        | Due to the native NodeJS crypto module's lack of API for
     |        | manipulating tweak values for individual sectors, an 8-byte
     |        | IV is used together with an 8-byte sector address to produce
     |        | custom IVs and emulate the tweak behavior. Although at the
     |        | cost of less secure encryption.
-----|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------
16B  | Binary | AES/XTS key check - 16 null bytes encrypted with the original
     |        | key. This region is used to verify whether the correct 
     |        | encryption key is used whenever a user wants to access the 
     |        | volume's content.
-----|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------
8B   | Int64  | Volume size (in bytes) - This value is set when creating a
     |        | new volume and when resizing it, as one of the integrity 
     |        | safeguards.
-----|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------
1B   | Int8   | Metadata sectors count - The number of sectors following the 
     |        | root sector that are allocated specifically to store arbitrary 
     |        | JSON metadata used by the filesystem drivers to store
     |        | configuration, user settings, debug information, etc.
