# IBFS
IBFS (Indirect Block File System) is a 64-bit virtual filesystem designed with strict focus on 
security and low implementation complexity. The primary purpose of this project is to provide an 
easy to implement security layer for network file sharing services through **virtualization**, 
native **encryption** and fine-grained **directory-scoped permissions**.

# Specification
The final IBFS (v2) specification is currently a work-in-progress and can be found [here](./spec/spec-2.0.md).
