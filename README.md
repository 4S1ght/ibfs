# IBFS
IBFS is a fully custom filesystem designed specifically to provide a virtualization layer for network file sharing solutions such as hosting sites, network attached storage, upload sites and anything else that requires user-provided data and may benefit from extra security against directory traversal, file inclusion or arbitrary file upload attacks.

The specification can be found [here](./spec/spec-1.0.md).
